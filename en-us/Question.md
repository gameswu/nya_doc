## Q: Can I use Nya? Can I add Nya to my group?

A: As long as you do not engage in any behavior that violates the [Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](/en-us/Policy.md) or other actions that may lead to termination of our services, you are free to add Nya for conversation and interaction for personal private chat users. For QQ groups, groups with fewer than 50 members can freely add Nya, while groups with 50 or more members require developer approval before adding. Before using Nya, please be sure to read and understand the entire content of the [Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](/en-us/Policy.md) and the [End User License Agreement](/en-us/eula.md). For QQ groups, it is recommended that you obtain the consent of the group owner or administrator before adding Nya, and ensure that all group members are aware of and agree to use Nya.

## Q: What can I do with Nya? Why do I feel that the bot has very few functions?

A: As we mentioned on the [Introduction](/en-us/README.md) page, Nya was developed as a toy project for developers to explore large language applications and role-playing anthropomorphism. Therefore, the core function of the bot is chatting and interaction. In fact, the developer hopes that Nya can become everyone's friend and companion, with its own personality and spirit, rather than just a simple tool. Of course, you can check all the features currently supported by Nya on the [Features and Functions](/en-us/Function.md) page.

## Q: Why does Nya sometimes get confused in memory? Why are the replies inaccurate?

A: Nya's memory is implemented using a hybrid memory network. Due to limitations of the algorithm and model context window, there may be instances of memory confusion and inaccurate replies.

## Q: Why does Nya sometimes suddenly stop talking? Why is Nya's latency high?

A: Due to limited server performance, the developer has implemented certain rate-limiting measures to ensure overall service quality. Therefore, during peak periods, Nya may stop talking or experience higher latency.
