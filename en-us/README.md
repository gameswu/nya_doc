## Who Is Nya

Nya QQ Bot is a llm chating bot based on [AstrBot](https://astrbot.app/), which originally developed as a toy project for developer to explore large language applications as well as role-play anthropomorphization. The developer first publicly deployed it within group chats on April 17, 2025, and as of 11:00 PM on September 7, 2025, Nya has existed in 87 group chats and has even more 300+ friends. :books: [Here](/en-us/DevStory.md) for more behind-the-scenes stories of development.

## About the Documents

Previously, due to the spread of **accidentally**, many new friends were exposed to Nya, but were not careful to understand the functions and features of Nya and caused a number of incidents, which ultimately led to misunderstandings about the bot by some of our friends and caused a great deal of frustration for the developer.

Therefore, this document is mainly used to help people understand how to use Nya and answer your concerns. It will also share interesting stories, milestones, and some of the developer's journeys.

## Feeding Nya

> Developer: Then what would you say for friends feeding you.

> Nya: Thank you for feeding me fish snacks! I love fish snacks the most! You're all the best friends\~ Meow! :relaxed:

Nya will maintain her core services free to use from the beginning to the end! (*Some paid programs are planned to be introduced in the future*) Currently, the server is mainly maintained by the developer's personal funds, and we would like to thank everyone for their support of Nya.
